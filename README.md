# Health Resource Tracker

This app tracks resource flows in the health sector from their many sources to the ultimate health function they serve. Information about health spending, both planned and realized, are essential for evidence-based budgeting, planning and policy-making.

## Getting Started

### Git config

    # .git/config

    [remote "origin"]
      fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
      url = git@github.com:siyelo/hrt.git

    [remote "staging"]
      url = git@heroku.com:hrtstaging.git
      fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/staging/*

    [remote "production"]
      url = git@heroku.com:hrtprod.git
      fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/production/*

### rbenv/RVM

Preferably use rbenv.

We are no longer supporting RVM.

Database:

  cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml

Edit config/database.yml per your environment.  This file is not tracked by git.

  rake db:setup

  rake db:populate [optional]


### Feature Dev

Tests/TDD - before every commit, and after every fetch, is your friend.

  $ rake test

Develop on a local feature branch, make a pull request via GitHub.
